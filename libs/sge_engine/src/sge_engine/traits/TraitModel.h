/// @brief TraitModel is a trait designed to be attached in an Actor.
/// It provides a simple way to assign a renderable 3D Model to the game object (both animated and static).
/// The trait is not automatically updateable, the user needs to manually call @postUpdate() method in their objects.
/// This is because not all game object need this complication of auto updating.
///
/// For Example:
///
///    Lets say that you have a actor that is some collectable, a coin from Super Mario.
///    That coin 3D model is never going to change, you know that the game object is only going to use
///    that one specfic 3D model that you can set in @Actor::create method with @TraitModel::setModel() and forget about it.
///    You do not need any upadates on it, nor you want to be able to change the 3D model from the Property Editor Window.
///    In this situation you just add the trait, set the model and you are done.
///
///    The situation where the 3D model might change is for example with some Decore.
///    Lets say that your 3D artist has prepared a grass and bush models that you want to scatter around the level.
///    It would be thedious to have a separate game object for each 3D model.
///    Instead you might do what the @AStaticObstacle does, have the model be changed via Propery Editor Window.
///    In that way you have I generic actor type that could be configured to your desiers.
///    In order for the game object to take into account the change you need in your Actor::postUpdate to
///    to update the trait, see if the model has been changed and maybe update the rigid body for that actor.
